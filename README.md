## The Problem

Most AI coding templates burn your token budget on coordination before a single line of code gets written. 49 agents debating with directors and leads just to decide what to do next works great for a studio with unlimited API credits.

For a solo dev on a weekly limit, it burns your cap with nothing to show.

---

## The Solution

This template strips everything down to what actually matters:

| | Typical multi-agent | Solo Studio |
|---|---|---|
| Agents | 20–49 | **6** |
| Hierarchy | Director → Lead → Worker | **None — direct specialists** |
| Inter-agent calls | Constant | **Zero** |
| Slash commands | 20+ | **10 practical ones** |
| Token overhead | High | **Near zero** |
| Token budget going to code | ~30–50% | **~95%** |

**6 specialists. No hierarchy. No coordination overhead. Nearly 100% of your tokens go to actual game code.**

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Godot 4 or Unity installed
- Git

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghraven/Claude-Code-Solo-Studio my-game
cd my-game
claude
```

Then in Claude Code:
```
/setup
```

Answer 4 questions. Your project is ready in seconds.

---

## /setup — What It Does

The setup command asks:

1. **Platform** — Android · PC · Web
2. **Dimension** — 2D · 3D
3. **Genre** — Platformer · RPG · Puzzle · Shooter · Other
4. **Engine** — Godot 4 · Unity (with a tip card to help you choose)

Then generates in one shot:
- `CLAUDE.md` filled with your project config
- Full folder structure (`src/` · `assets/` · `design/` · `docs/` · `tests/`)
- Starter scene and script files for your engine
- `design/gdd.md` — Game Design Document stub ready to fill in

---

## Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/setup` | Initialize project — platform · genre · engine · starter files |
| `/new-feature` | Start a feature (breaks into max 5 focused tasks) |
| `/level-design` | Design a level with scene structure |
| `/ui-design` | Design a menu · HUD · screen |
| `/code-review` | Review code for bugs and quality issues |
| `/qa-check` | Full quality check before moving on |
| `/bug-report` | Log and fix a bug |
| `/build` | Export/build checklist for your target platform |
| `/status` | See current sprint and what's next |
| `/help` | List all commands |

---

## Agents

Use agents when you want deep focused work on a single domain. Slash commands handle most everyday tasks — agents are for when you need a specialist to go all-in on one area.

| Agent | Use for |
|---|---|
| `game-designer` | Mechanics · balancing · GDD updates |
| `programmer` | All code — GDScript or C# |
| `level-designer` | Level layouts · scene structure |
| `ui-designer` | Menus · HUD · screen design |
| `qa` | Code review · bugs · test cases |
| `release` | Builds · exports · versioning |

Every agent reads `CLAUDE.md` for project context — no re-explaining your engine, platform, or genre every session.

## Project Structure

```
my-game/
├── CLAUDE.md                Your project brain — update this as you build
├── .claude/

└── tests/                   Test cases
```

## How the Token Efficiency Works

**Agents don't talk to each other.** Each one has full context baked into its prompt and reads `CLAUDE.md` for project state. There's no coordination layer, no approval chains, no "consulting" step.

You stay in control. Claude starts coding immediately.

- Hooks only fire when relevant (commit hook exits instantly if not a commit)
- `CLAUDE.md` carries context across sessions — no context re-setup
- Specialists go straight to work — no meta-discussion about what to build

---

## Customization

Everything is plain Markdown — edit freely:

```bash
# Add a new agent
touch .claude/agents/my-agent.md

# Edit a slash command
nano .claude/skills/new-feature/prompt.md

# Add a hook
touch .claude/hooks/my-hook.sh
# Wire it in .claude/settings.json
```
